======

A tool for rapidly editing a webpage, saving it, then serving out the modified copy.

Intended for people and organizations that have need to both (A) troubleshoot web pages they do not control, and then (B) quickly share those modifications with other parties. In the author's case, supporting third-party JavaScript applications across hundreds of sites.

If only doing A, a real proxy tool (e.g. Charles Proxy) will give you better precision than this method. 

If you need others to see your quick edits -- designers, project managers, clients, sort of a "Hey, looks like if I make this edit to your web page: [a link to some HTML on gist.github.com] the page works: [link to your modified page on this application]."

Because of how some web pages are built, this tool doesn't work with every site. But it does work with quite a few.
